Developed in partnership with the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, the goal of this project is to assess the integrity of the mooring system on oil extraction platforms based on motion data such as GPS and IMU data. My research project was individual, although it is part of a bigger project, and I had to process motion signals to extract relevant features, which were later used on a machine learning model to obtain the results.
