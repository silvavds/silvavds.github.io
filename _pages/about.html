<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>I am an Electrical Engineering student at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br">University of São Paulo</a> currently doing a double degree in Multidisciplinary Engineering at the <a href="https://centralelille.fr">École Centrale de Lille</a>. I am also an undergraduate researcher working in a project in colaboration with the <a href="https://www.chu-lille.fr">Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille</a>. My main interests are solving real-life relevant problems with a data analysis approach, robotics and anything data related.</p>
<p>I have previously worked on projects applying computer vision to mobile robotics, and more recently applying artificial intelligence to detect failure on the mooring lines of oil platforms (more specifically FPSO units) for the Brazilian company <a href="https://petrobras.com.br/en/">Petrobras</a>. This work was published in the <a href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/siicusp/">International Symposium of the University of São Paulo</a> and awarded Best work of the section during the international phase of the congress.</p>
<p>I am also part of the Tech Fellow academic excellence program at <a href="https://www.estudar.org.br">Fundação Estudar</a> from the 2022 group, in which 23 candidates were selected out of 4285 applicants, which has as its main purpose to help high-performing Brazilian students to study abroad.</p>
<p>My goals are to learn as much as I can in any given opportunity and bring a positive impact on the lives of people. Do not hesitate to contact me for a talk!</p>
